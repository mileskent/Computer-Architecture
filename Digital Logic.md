Logic with discrete signals
See [[Logic Gate]], [[XOR Gate]], [[NAND Gate]],
	[[NOR Gate]], [[NOT Gate]], [[AND Gate]], [[OR Gate]],
	[[Transistor]]s, [[Karnaugh Map]]

#### [[Combinational Logic]] or [[Sequential Logic]]
**Combinational**
* Combine [[Logic Gate]]; deterministic
**Sequential**
* Requires storage, See [[SR Latch]]
* Output also depends on state
* Used to build memory and state machines
Combinational and Sequential logic interact with eachother
