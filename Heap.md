The heap is a region of memory ([[RAM#DRAM]]) used for allocating variable-sized blocks of memory at runtime, allowing for flexible data structures. Unlike stack memory, which is managed automatically, memory allocated on the heap must be manually deallocated by the programmer to prevent memory leaks.
