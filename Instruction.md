A string of bits that encodes a task for the [[Processor]], specified in the [[Instruction Set Architecture]]

The fastest [[Microarchitecture]] is one with fixed format.
The beginning of the instruction is the [[Opcode]]
The remaining bits depend on the instruction, but in the case of ADD, for example it would follow with: destination register, source register, 0s, source register 2
Machine Instructions are stored contiguously in memory. 
The [[Program Counter]] keeps track fo the instruction we want to execute.
