#### Types
* [[NOT Gate]]
* [[OR Gate]]
* [[NOR Gate]]
* [[NAND Gate]]
* [[AND Gate]]
* [[XOR Gate]]

#### Diagramming
* They are also called "bubbles"
* Circle -> Negation
	* [[NOT Gate]] has a triangle before the circle to indicate that it is a gate
* Curve input -> [[OR Gate]]/[[NOR Gate]]
* Straight input -> [[AND Gate]]/[[NAND Gate]]
* Double Curve input -> [[XOR Gate]]
