The Microarchitecture is more concerned with the lower level implementation of how the instructions are going to be executed and deals with concepts like Instruction Pipelining, Branch Prediction, Out of Order Execution, as opposed to an [[ISA]]. Different processors can share the same ISA (e.g. Intel iX series all use x86) but have different underlying microarchitectures.
