A **microprogrammed control unit** is a type of CPU [control unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_unit) that generates the control signals needed to execute machine instructions by reading [[Microcode]]. This control unit, controls the [[Finite State Machine]] that keeps track of the states of all of the gates and mux signals and such, directing the control flow of the [[ISA]] and [[Macrostate]]s 

> [!note]+ Georgia Tech
> Georgia Tech seems to uniquely call microprogrammed control units microcontrollers and microcontrol unit
