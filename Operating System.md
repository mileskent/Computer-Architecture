Operating Systems are about sharing resources and protecting users from themeselves and others. Performing certain operations require *specialized knowledge* and *protection* which not every programmer knows or wants to know, so we abstract them in an Operating System Machine Layer. We transparently provide service to I/O devices and we notify user programs of unexpected situations. We provide *service routines* or *system calls* as part of the Operating System to safely and convieniently perform low-level, priviledged operations.
