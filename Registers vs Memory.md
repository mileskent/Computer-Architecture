| Registers hold the operands or instruction that CPU is currently processing.                    | Memory holds the instructions and the data that the currently executing program in CPU requires. |
| Register holds the small amount of data around 32-bits to 64-bits.                              | Memory of the computer can range from some GB to TB.                                             |
| CPU can operate on register contents at the rate of more than one operation in one clock cycle. | CPU accesses memory at the slower rate than register.                                            |
| Types are Accumulator register, Program counter, Instruction register, Address register, etc.   | Type of memory are RAM, etc.                                                                     |
| Registers can be control i.e. you can store and retrieve information from them.                 | Memory is almost not controllable.                                                               |
| Registers are faster than memory.                                                               | RAM is much slower than registers.                                                               |
