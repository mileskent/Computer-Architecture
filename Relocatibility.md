# Dynamically Relocatable
[[Process]] is can be relocated anywhere in memory.
[[Virtual Address]]es in the program are translated into physical addresses during run time by the [[Memory Management#Memory Broker]]. 
# Statically Relocatable
Process is only valid in the position in memory where it was initialized.
A result of when the [[Assembler]] hardcodes memory locations for labels and no advanced [[Memory Management|Memory Brokerage]].
