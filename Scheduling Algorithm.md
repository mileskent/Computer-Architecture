An [[Algorithm]] used by the [[Scheduler]]
# Preemptive
Algorithm that forcible takes the [[Processor]] away from the current scheduled [[Process]] in response to an external event (e.g. I/O completion [[Discontinuities#Interrupt]], timer interrupt)
## Shortest Remaining Time First
## Round Robin
## Priority
![[Round Robin]]
# Nonpreemptive
An algorithm that allows the current scheduled process on the [[CPU]] to voluntarily reliquish the processor (either by terminating or making an I/O system call)
