An electronic switch.
* When it is/is not powered, the "switch" is engaged and current can flow through, and vice versa, depending on the type
* "Gate"

Want to minimize transistor use, because they take power

### Types of Transistors
Work in the opposite way of the other
* [[nMOS]]
	* Power -> connects switch
* [[pMOS]]
	* Power -> disconnects switch
