* Kind of [[Tree]] where every node must have 2-4 children, and 1-3 data values.
* **Guarantees** $O(\log n)$ operations through [[#Balancing Scheme]]
* Structure
	* 2-4 Children
	* 1-3 data values
	* m data values have m + 1 children, and vice versa
	* Nodes grow and shrink with the data
* Shape > Order > Node
* Data always gets put into a leaf initially when added
* When promotion occurs in a node with 3 siblings, promote the value as normally, and split as normally. There will temporarily be 4 data in the parent and 5 children. This will be resolved by the enforcement of balancing scheme, as the parent node will also promote. The overflow will be promoted up the tree in general until resolution.
* When fusion happens with a parent of one value, there will temporarily be a node with 0 values and children.
# Balancing Scheme
***TLDR:*** 
* ***All leaves must have same depth***
* ***All Nodes must have 2-4 children***
* ***All Node must have 1-3 data values.***

## Shape Property
All leaves must have same depth
## Order Property
$c_1 < d_1 < c_2 < d_2 < c_3 < d_3 < c_4$
## Node Property
$d_n$ is the nth value
$c_n$ is the nth child
Each node must have 1-3 data
Each node must have 2-4 children

# Adding
Similar to other Tree adding methods, adding is simpler than removing
## Overflow
* Recall that every node must have 1 - 3 data. If we add more than this, we enter *overflow*. In order to resolve overflow with me "promote" one of the middle nodes. This node is either the second or third node, and the choice is arbitrary. 
* When a promotion occurs
	* The promoted value is moved upwards
		* Either into the *node above it*
		* Into a new root if being promoted from the current root
	* The overflowed node is "split" while maintaining the [[#Order Property]].

# Removing
* Remove the data
* If the node is an internal node, replace it with its [[Predeccesor]]/[[Successor]].
If you remove from a [[Leaf]] without [[#Underflow|Underflowing]] it, that's all! ðŸ™‚
## Underflow
When removing, we may get a node with 0 values. This is called *underflow* and it is resolved by [[#Transfer]] and [[#Fusion]]. 
* *A transfer is preferrable over a fusion, because fusion may propagate underflow up the tree.*
* If you propogate underflow up to the root, it gets deleted.
### Transfer
Transfer between parent and child. In either direction. Applicable if the node we are stealing from has multiple data.
> [!example]- Parent to Child
> ![[Pasted image 20250423185059.png|200]]
> Replace with [[Predeccesor]]/[[Successor]]. 18 replaces 12. This is because 12 is an internal node. This is not specific to transfer.
> 
> This child node is underflowed, so we need to steal from the parent.
> Check the adjacent siblings of the node for more than 1 value. 
> ![[Pasted image 20250423184249.png|200]]
> If there is one that satisfies this, move that data into the parent, pushing the value in front of it into the empty node.

> [!example]- Child to Parent
> We are in the process of balancing this 2-4 tree. There was some underflow that originated on the right side that propogated all the way up the tree. 
> ![[Pasted image 20250423191546.png|300]]
> 
> The root is underflowed, so we steal from one of the children, because the left child has two values. 20 is the closest value.
> 
> In order to enforce the [[#Order Property]], the 2428 node is moved while maintaining the property.
> ![[Pasted image 20250423191807.png|300]]

### Fusion
Fusion between siblings with single data. When [[#Transfer]] is not an option.
> [!Example]-
> ![[Pasted image 20250423185144.png|200]]
> ![[Pasted image 20250423185237.png|200]]
> Check for [[#Transfer]]. It is not possible in this case because the siblings only have 1 value each.
> 
> Bring down the closest data value into the underflowed node.
> ![[Pasted image 20250423185534.png|200]]
> 
> Fuse the data that was brought down from the parent and its neighboring sibling.
