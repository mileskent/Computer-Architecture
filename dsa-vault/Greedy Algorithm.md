An [[Algorithm]] that makes locally optimal choices with the goal of reaching a global optimum.
* This strategy works for [[Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm]] it can be arbitrarily bad for other problems
* Greedy strategies are usually very simple to implement
	* While not done and conditions true, choose best option
* Best algorithms are often greedy algorithms with an optimization/trick
	* Often the trick involves [[Dynamic Programming]]
* Greedy strategies are usually somewhat efficient, yielding polynomial time solutions.
* These strategies can often give good approximations in practice. 
### Examples
[[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]
[[Prim's Algorithm]]
[[Kruskal's Algorithm]]
