A [[Spanning Tree]] of a [[Graph]] that minimizes [[Edge]] [[Weight]]. "MST".
* i.e. an [[Cyclic|Acyclic]] [[Connected]] [[Graph]] that minimizes [[Edge]] [[Weight]]
* e.g. Each house is a [[Vertex]], each [[Edge]] is [[Weight|Weighted]] according to the cost of connecting the given pair of houses, the problem is optimally connect a given [[Graph]] of houses into a WAN 
* Multiple MSTs may be possible for a single graph.
* Any MST **must** include the minimum edge connecting the two [[Subgraph]]s left by **any** possible [[Graph Cut]]
