Recursive calls go onto the Call [[Stack]] and are popped off when the base case is reached.

Code before recusive call: before recursive stack, while going through
Code after recursive call: after recursive stack, while backtracking

###### [[Binary Search Tree]]
A recursive structure, therefore use recursion.
When recursing on a tree, need to handle 3 cases, where the order might change
1. Handle curr node
2. Handle left [[Subtree]]
3. Handle right [[Subtree]]
