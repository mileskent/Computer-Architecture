* A [[Graph]] is *Simple* if and only if 
	* There are no [[Edge|edges]] the start and end at the same [[Vertex]] (*Self-Loop*)
	* There are not multiple edges that have the same start and end vertex (*Parallel Edges*)
		* Direction matters for this definition edge A->B $\neq$ edge B->A
* A graph is *Non-Simple* (multigraph) when it is not *Simple*
