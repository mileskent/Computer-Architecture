* Node based structure, subset of [[Graph|graphs]]
	* An [[Cyclic|Ayclic]], [[Connected]] [[Graph]], with exactly one [[Path]] between any pair of [[Vertex|vertices]]
* A graph is a tree iff it has |V| - 1 edges and is connected or it has |V| - 1 edges and is acyclic
* Parent-child, Ancestor-descendant-sibling
Rules
1. Node can have any number of children
2. Node can have 0 or 1 parents
3. Node with 0 parents is the root node
4. All nodes in the tree must be connected / no cycled allowed
	* These statements are equivalent

* Leaf node has no children
* Internal node is any node that is not a leaf
* "Subtree", self-explanatory
